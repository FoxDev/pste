Just a simple file hosting application inspired by the likes of pomf.se and teknik.io.

Very early alpha, 100% definitely not ready whatsoever for production use. Not even for a laugh.

[Demo (master branch)](https://dev.pste.pw)

# Quick Installation (dev)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FoxDev/pste
cd pste
pipenv install
cp .env.default .env # Edit .env
pipenv shell
flask db upgrade
flask user create # Or use /auth/register
flask run # Do not use this in production, use a WSGI server with app:create_app() as your entrypoint.
```
